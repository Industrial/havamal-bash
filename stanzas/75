Veita hinn                        He does not know,
er vættki veit                    he who knows nothing;
margr verðr af aurum api          many a man becomes a fool through ores [money];
maðr er auðigr                    one man is rich,
annarr óauðigr                    another poor;
skylit þann vítka vár             he must not blame his woe on him.
