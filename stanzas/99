Aptr ek hvarf                     Back I turned
ok unna þóttumk                   and seemed out of my head
vísum vilja frá                   with love;
hitt ek hugða                     I thought
at ek hafa mynda                  that I would have
geð hennar alt ok gaman           it all, her heart and pleasure.
