Vesall maðr                       The wretched man
ok illa skapi                     of bad character
hlær at hvívetna                  laughs at all kinds of things.
hitki hann veit                   On the other hand he doesn't know
er hann vita þyrpti               what he ought to know,
at hann era vamma vanr            that he is not lacking in faults.
