Elds er þörf                      There is need of fire
þeims inn er kominn               for him who is come in
ok á kné kalinn                   with cold knees;
matar ok váða                     there is need of food and clothes
es manni þörf                     for the man
þeims hefir um fjall farit        who has journeyed on the mountainside.
