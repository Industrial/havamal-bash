Vits er þörf                      Sense is needed
þeims viða ratar                  for the one who travels widely;
dælt er heima hvat                everything is easy at home.
at augabragði verðr               He who knows nothing
sá er ekki kann                   and sits with wise men
ok með snotrum sitr               becomes a mockery.
