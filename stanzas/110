Baugeið Óðinn                     Othinn, I think, has sworn
hygg ek at unnit hafi             an oath on the sacred ring --
hvat skal hans tryggðum trúa?     who shall trust in his troth?
Suttung svikinn                   he had Suttungr cheated
hann lét sumbli frá               of his mead,
ok grœtta Gunnlöðu                and made Gunnloth grieve.
