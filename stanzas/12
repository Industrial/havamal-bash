Era svá gótt                      Ale is not as good
sem gótt kveða                    as it is said to be good
öl alda sonum                     for the sons of men;
því at færa veit                  because the man knows less
er fleira drekkr                  -- he who drinks more --
síns til geðs gumi                of his disposition.
