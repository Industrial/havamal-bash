Opt vitu ógörla                   Often they don't precisely know,
þeir er sitja inni fyrir          those who sit first in a house,
hvers þeir ro kyns er koma        whose kinsmen they are who come (later);
erat maðr svá góðr                no man is so good
at galli ne fylgi                 that no fault follows him,
né svá illr at einugi dugi        nor so bad that he is of no use.
