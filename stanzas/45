Ef þú át annan                    If you have another
þanns þú illa trúir               whom you mistrust,
vildu af honum þó gótt geta       but you want to get something good from him,
fagrt skalt við þann mæla         you must speak fair to him,
en flátt hyggja                   and think deceitful thoughts,
ok gjalda lausung við lygi        and give deception in return for a lie.
