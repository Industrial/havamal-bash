Vápnum sínum                      A man in the open country must not
skala maðr velli á                go more than one step
feti ganga framar                 from his weapons;
því at óvist er at vita           because one can't be sure
nær verðr á vegum úti             when, outside on the roads,
geirs um þörf guma                a spear will be needed by a warrior.
