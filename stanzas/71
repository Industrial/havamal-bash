Haltr ríðr hrossi                 The lame man rides a horse,
hjörð rekr handarvanr             the one-armed man drives the herd,
daufr vegr ok dugir               the deaf man fights and is useful;
blindr er betri                   it is better to be blind
en brenndr sé                     than burnt;
nýtr manngi nás                   no-one is helped by a corpse.
