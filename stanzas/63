Fregna ok segja                   Each of the wise must
skal fróðra hverr                 ask and reply,
sá er vill heitinn horskr         he who wishes to be called wise;
einn vita                         one alone must know
né annarr skal                    but not another;
þjóð veit ef þrír ro              the people knows if there are three [who know].
