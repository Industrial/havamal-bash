Fróðr þykkisk                     He seems wise,
sá er flótta tekr                 the guest who takes flight
gestr at gest hæðinn              from the mocking guest;
veita görla                       he does not know for certain,
sá er of verði glissir            he who mocks over a meal,
þótt hann með grömum glami        whether he talks loudly among enemies.
