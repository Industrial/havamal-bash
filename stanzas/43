Vin sínum                         A man must be a friend
skal maðr vinr vera               to his friend,
þeim ok þess vinr                 for himself and for the friend,
en óvinar síns                    but no man must
skyli engi maðr                   be a friend of a friend
vinar vinr vera                   of his foe.
