Ráðumk þér Loddfáfnir             I advise you, Loddfafnir,
en þú ráð nemir                   to take advice;
njóta mundu ef þú nemr            you would benefit, it you took it,
þér munu góð ef þú getr           good will come to you, if you accept it;
illu feginn                       never be
verðu aldregi                     glad in evil,
en lát þér at góðu getit          but let yourself be pleased by good.
