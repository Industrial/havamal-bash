Þat er enn of þann                There is more about the one
er þú illa trúir                  whom you mistrust
ok þér er grunr at hans geði      and whose disposition you suspect;
hlæja skaltu við þeim             you should laugh with him
ok um hug mæla                    and speak other than your thought.
glík skulu gjöld gjöfum           There should be repayment for such gifts.
