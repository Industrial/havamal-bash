Mikilsti snemma                   I came to many places
kom ek í marga staði              very much too soon,
en til síð í suma                 and too late to some;
öl var drukkit                    sometimes the ale was drunk,
sumt var ólagat                   sometimes it wasn't ready;
sjaldan hittir leiðr í lið        the unwelcome one seldom hits the spot.
