Gröðugr halr                      A greedy man,
nema geðs viti                    unless he knows his mind,
etr sér aldrtrega                 often causes his life's sorrow by eating;
opt fær hlœgis                    often the stomach gains ridicule,
er með horskum kømr               when he comes among wise men,
manni heimskum magi               for the foolish man.
