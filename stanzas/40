Féar síns                         A man should not endure want
er fengit hefir                   when he has gained
skylit maðr þörf þola             his money;
opt sparir leiðum                 often he saves for enemies
þats hefir ljúfum hugat           what he has intended for friends;
mart gengr verr en varir          much goes worse than expected.
