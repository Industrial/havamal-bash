Billings mey                      I found her in bed,
ek fann beðjum á                  Billingr's kinswoman,
sólhvíta sofa                     sun-white, asleep;
jarls ynði                        a jarl's delight
þótti mér ekki vera               seemed nothing to me,
nema við þat lík at lifa          unless I could live with that body.
