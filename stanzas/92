Fagrt skal mæla                   Fairly must he speak
ok fé bjóða                       and offer gifts,
sá er vill fljóðs ást fá          he who wants to win a woman's love;
líki leyfa                        praise the figure
ins ljósa mans                    of the fair maiden;
sá fær er fríar                   he wins who flatters.
