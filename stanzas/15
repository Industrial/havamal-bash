Þagalt ok hugalt                  A ruler's son must be
skyli þjóðans barn                silent and thoughtful
ok vígdjarft vera                 and brave in battle;
glaðr ok reifr                    each man must be
skyli gumna hverr                 happy and cheerful
unz sínn bíðr bana                until he suffers death.
