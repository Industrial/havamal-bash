Ljóð ek þau kann                  I know the songs
er kannat þjóðans kona            that no ruler's wife knows,
ok mannskis mögr                  nor anyone's son;
hjálp heitir eitt                 the first is called Help,
en þat þér hjálpa mun              and it will help you
við sökum ok sorgum               with disputes and griefs
ok sútum görvöllum                and absolutely all sorrows.
