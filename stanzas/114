Hon svá gørir                     -- she will make sure
at þú gáir eigi                   that you do not heed
þings né þjóðans máls             the speech of either Thing (assembly) or king;
mat þú villat                     you will not desire food
né mannskis gaman                 or mankind's pleasure;
ferr þú sorgafullr at sofa [#]    you will go sorrowfully to sleep.
