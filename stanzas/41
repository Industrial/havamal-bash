Vápnum ok váðum                   Friends must gladden each other
skulu vinir gleðjask              with weapons and clothes,
þat er á sjalfum sýnst            which are most evident on themselves.
viðr gefendr ok endrgefendr       givers in return and repeat-givers
erusk vinir lengst,               are friends the longest
ef þat bíðr at verða vel          if it endures to turn out well.
