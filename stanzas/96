Þat ek þá reynda                  That I proved
er ek í reyri sat                 when I sat in the reeds
ok vættak míns munar              and waited for my love;
hold ok hjarta                    the wise maid to me
var mér in horska mær             was body and soul --
þeygi ek hana at heldr hefik      but still I do not have her.
