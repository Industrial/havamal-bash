Betra er lifðum                   It is better for the living
en sé ólifðum [#]                 than for the dead,
ey getr kvikr kú                  the living man always gets the cow;
eld sá ek upp brenna              I saw the fire burn up
auðgum manni fyrir                before a rich man,
en úti var dauðr fyr durum        but death was outside the door.
