Þurra skíða                       Man knows the measure of this,
ok þakinna næfra                  of dry sticks
þess kann maðr mjöt               and of birch-bark for roofing,
ok þess viðar                     and of this, of wood
er vinnask megi                   which will last
mál ok misseri                    for the short and long seasons.
