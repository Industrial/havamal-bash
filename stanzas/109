Ins hindra dags                   On the next day
gengu hrímþursar                  the frost giants went
Háva ráðs at fregna               to ask for Har's advice
Háva höllu í                      in Har's hall;
at Bölverki þeir spurðu           they asked about Bolverkr (the Evil-doer, Othinn),
ef hann væri með böndum kominn    whether he had come back among the gods,
eða hefði honum Suttungr of sóit  or whether Suttungr had sacrificed him.
