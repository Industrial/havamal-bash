Ganga skal                        The guest must go,
skala gestr vera                  he must not be
ey í einum stað                   always in the same place;
ljúfr verðr leiðr                 loved becomes loathed
ef lengi sitr                     if he stays a long time
annars fletjum á                  in the hall of another.
