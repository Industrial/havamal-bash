Váðir mínar                       My clothes
gaf ek velli at                   I gave in a field
tveim trémönnum                   to two wooden men;
rekkar þat þóttusk                they thought themselves warriors
er þeir ript höfðu                when they had clothing;
neiss er nøkkviðr halr            a naked man is shamed.
