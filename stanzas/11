Byrði betri                       A man does not bear
berrat maðr brautu at             a better burden on the road
en sé manvit mikit                than is great commonsense;
vegnest verra                     he does not carry a worse journey-provision
vegra hann velli at               in the open field than is
an sé ofdrykkja öls               the over-drinking of ale.
