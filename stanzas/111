Mál er at þylja                   It is time to recite
þular stóli á                     from the sage's throne
Urðar brunni at                   at Urthr's well;
sá ek ok þagðak                   I saw and stayed silent,
sá ek ok hugðak                   I saw and reflected,
hlýdda ek á manna mál             I listened to the speech of men,
of rúnar heyrða ek dœma           I heard and learned about runes,
né um ráðum þögþu                 nor were they silent in counsels
Háva höllu at                     at Har's hall,
Háva höllu í                      in Har's hall,
heyrða ek segja svá               thus I heard it said --
