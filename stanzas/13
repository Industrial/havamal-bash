Óminnishegri heitir               He is called the heron of forgetfulness,
sá er yfir ölðrum þrumir          he who hovers over ale-parties;
hann stelr geði guma              he steals the disposition of men.
þess fugls fjöðrum                By the feathers of this bird
ek fjötraðr vask                  I was fettered,
í garði Gunnlaðar                 in the courts of Gunnlöth.
