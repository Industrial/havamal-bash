Ráðumk þér Loddfáfnir             I advise you, Loddfafnir,
en þú ráð nemir                   to take advice;
njóta mundu ef þú nemr            you would benefit, it you took it,
þér munu góð ef þú getr           good will come to you, if you accept it;
ef þú vilt þér góða konu          if you want to attract
kveðja at gamanrúnum              a good woman to you with pleasant talk
ok fá fögnuð af                   and take pleasure with her,
fögru skaltu heita                you must make a fair promise
ok láta fast vera                 and stick fast to it
leiðisk manngi gott ef getr       -- no one loathes the good, if he gets it.
