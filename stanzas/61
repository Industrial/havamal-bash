Þveginn ok mettr                  A man should ride to the Thing
ríði maðr þingi at                washed and fed,
þótt hann sét væddr til vel       though he be not clothed too well;
skúa ok bróka                     let no man be ashamed
skammisk engi maðr                of shoes and breeches,
né hests in heldr                 nor of horse either,
þótt hann hafit góðan             even if he hasn't a good one.
