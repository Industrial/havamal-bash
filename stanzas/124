Sifjum er þá blandat              Peace and trust are exchanged
hverr er segja ræðr               when one can tell
einum allan hug                   another his whole mind.
alt er betra                      Anything is better
en sé brigðum at vera             than to be faithless;
era sá vinr öðrum                 he is not another's friend
er vilt eitt segir                who says only what the friend wants to hear.
