Brandr af brandi                  Firewood from firewood
brinn unz brunninn er             burns, until it is burnt,
funi kveykisk af funa             flame kindles from flame;
maðr af manni                     from man, man
verðr at máli kuðr                becomes wise in speech,
en til dœlskr af dul              but too foolish from folly.
