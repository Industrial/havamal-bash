Ósnotr maðr                       The unwise man
hyggr sér alla vera               thinks them all to be
viðhlæjendr vini                  his friends, those who laugh at him;
þá þat fiðr                       then he finds
er at þingi kømr                  when he comes to the Thing [assembly]
at hann á formælendr fá           that he has few supporters.
