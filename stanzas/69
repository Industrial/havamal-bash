Erat maðr alls vesall             A man is not wholly wretched,
þótt hann sé illa heill           though he be in rotten health;
sumr er af sonum sæll             one is blessed with sons,
sumr af frændum                   another with kinsmen,
sumr af fé œrnu                   another with plenty of money,
sumr af verkum vel                another with deeds well done.
