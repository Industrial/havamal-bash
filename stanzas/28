Fróðr sá þykkisk                  He seems wise,
er fregna kann                    he who knows how to ask
ok segja hit sama                 and to speak likewise;
eyvitu leyna                      they can conceal nothing,
megu ýta synir                    the sons of men,
því er gengr of guma              of what is said about men.
