Ósnotr maðr                       The unwise man
þykkisk alt vita                  thinks he knows everything
ef hann á sér í vá veru           if he has refuge for himself in a corner.
hitki hann veit                   but he does not know
hvat hann skal við kveða          what he must say in reply,
ef hans freista firar             if men test him.
