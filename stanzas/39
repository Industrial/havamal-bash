Fanka ek mildan mann              I have not found a man so liberal
eða svá matar góðan               or so generous with food
at værit þiggja þegit             that to accept was not accepted,
eða síns féar                     or so free
svá gjöflan [#]                   with his money
at leið sé laun ef þiggr          that the reward is unwelcome if he gets one.
