Árliga verðar                     A man should often take
skyli maðr opt fá                 a meal early,
nema til kynnis komi              unless he comes to visit friends;
sitr ok snópir                    [else] he sits and looks around hungrily,
lætr sem solginn sé               behaves as though he's famished,
ok kann fregna at fá              and can talk about little.
