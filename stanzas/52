Mikit eitt                        One should not give a man
skala manni gefa                  a single large gift;
opt kaupir sér í lítlu lof        often one can obtain for onself with a little praise;
með hálfum hleifi                 with half a loaf
ok með höllu keri                 and with a sloping goblet
fekk ek mér félaga                I got myself a comrade.
