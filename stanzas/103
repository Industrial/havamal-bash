Heima glaðr gumi                  At home a man must be glad
ok við gesti reifr                and cheerful with guests,
sviðr skal um sik vera            knowing about himself,
minnigr ok málugr                 mindful and fluent,
ef hann vill margfróðr vera       if he wants to be well-informed;
opt skal góðs geta                he should often speak of good things.
fimbulfambi heitir                He is called a monstrous fool,
sá er fátt kann segja             the one who knows how to say almost nothing;
þat er ósnotrs aðal               it is the character of the unwise.
