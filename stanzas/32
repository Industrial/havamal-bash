Gunnar margir                     Many men
erusk gagnhollir                  are most friendly with each other
en at virði vrekask               and yet fight over food;
aldar róg                         strife among men
þat mun æ vera                    will always be;
órir gestr við gest               guest will be hostile to guest.
