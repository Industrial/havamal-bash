Hér ok hvar                       Here and there
myndi mér heim of boðit           I would be invited home
ef þyrftak at málungi mat         if I needed no food at meals;
eða tvau lær hengi                or two hams would hang
at ins tryggva vinar              at a loyal friend's
þars ek hafða eitt etit           where I had eaten one.
