Ráðumk þér Loddfáfnir             I advise you, Loddfafnir,
en þú ráð nemir                   to take advice;
njóta mundu ef þú nemr            you would benefit, it you took it,
þér munu góð ef þú getr           good will come to you, if you accept it;
þrimr orðum senna                 you must not dispute even three words
skalattu þér við verra mann       with a man less worthy than you;
opt inn betri bilar               often the better man is defeated
þá er inn verri vegr              when the worser attacks.
