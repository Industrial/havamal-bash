Ósnotr maðr                       The unwise man
hyggr sér alla vera               thinks them all to be
viðhlæjendr vini                  his friends, those who laugh at him;
hitki hann fiðr                   he does not notice
þótt þeir um hann fár lesi        even if they express malice against him
ef hann með snotrum sitr          when he sits among wise men.
