Sá er sæll                        He is blessed
er sjalfr of á                    who has within himself
lof ok vit meðan lifir            praise and sense while he lives,
því at ill röð                    because man has often received
hefr maðr opt þegit               ill-counsel
annars brjóstum ór                from the breast of another.
