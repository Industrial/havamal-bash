Nú era Háva mál                   Now the sayings of Har are spoken
kveðin Háva höllu í               in Har's hall,
allþörf ýta sonum                 very needful to the sons of men,
óþörf jötna sonum                 harmful to the sons of giants.
heill sá er kvað                  Hail to him who spoke!
heill sá er kann                  Hail to him who understands!
njóti sá er nam                   Let him benefit who took them!
heilir þeirs hlýddu               Blessings on those who listened!
