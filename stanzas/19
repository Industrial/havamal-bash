Haldit maðr á keri                Do not let a man hold on to a goblet,
drekki þó at hófi mjöð            but let him drink mead in moderation,
mæli þarft eða þegi               let him talk sense or be silent.
ókynnis þess                      No man blames you
var þik engi maðr                 of bad manners,
at þú gangir snemma at sofa       that you go early to sleep.
