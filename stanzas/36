Bú er betra                       The dwelling is better,
þótt lítit sé                     though it be small;
halr er heima hverr               each man is a free man at home;
þótt tvær geitr                   though he own two she-goats
eigi ok taugreptan sal            and a hall roofed with withies,
þat er þó betra an bœn            it is still better than begging.
