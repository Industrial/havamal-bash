Ofarla bíta                       I saw a man
ek sá einum hal                   deeply bitten
orð illrar konu;                  by the word of a bad woman;
fláráð tunga [#]                  her deceit-crafty tongue
varð honum at fjörlagi            was the death of him,
ok þeygi um sanna sök             and yet the charge was not true.
