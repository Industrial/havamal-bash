Við hleifi mik sældu              They cheered me with a loaf
né við hornigi                    and not with any horn,
nýsta ek niðr                     I investigated down below,
nam ek upp rúnar                  I took up the runes,
œpandi nam                        screaming I took them,
fell ek aptr þaðan                and I fell back from there.
