Ráðumk þér Loddfáfnir             I advise you, Loddfafnir,
en þú ráð nemir                   to take advice;
njóta mundu ef þú nemr            you would benefit, it you took it,
þér munu góð ef þú getr           good will come to you, if you accept it;
veiztu ef þú vin átt              know this, if you have a friend
þanns þú vel trúir                whom you trust well,
farðu at finna opt                go to visit him often,
því at hrísi vex                  for the path which no-one treads
ok hávu grasi                     grows with underbrush
vegr er vættki trøðr              and high grass.
