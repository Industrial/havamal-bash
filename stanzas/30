At augabragði                     A man must not make
skala maðr anna hafa              a mockery of another
þótt til kynnis komi              when he comes to visit acquaintances;
margr þá fróðr þykkisk            many a man seems wise
ef hann freginn erat              if he is not questioned
ok nái hann þurrfjallr þruma      and manages to sit quiet, unscathed.
